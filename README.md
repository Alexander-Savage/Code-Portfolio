# A place to show off!

Finally starting this project September 2023. Lets see how quickly I can link up a website (Front + Backend) to show off my skills and enthusiasm. Currently have 2 years of mostly backend experience and looking to expand my horizons.

## Some of my other backend code projects (And hopefully many more to come!):

- A.I. breast cancer predictor (small dataset, good results)
- A-Level Futher Mathematics Matrices Calculator. (As part of Computer Science A-Level NEA)
- CS50 (As a team)
- Guitar Shack (Some extreme TDD training)

### Plan for this project:

1. Show my front end capabilities.
2. Show some backend code/projects.
3. Show I understand API's, setting up my own API definition and calling the API to connect the back and front end. (currently using fastAPI)
4. Setup a (probably simplistic) GitActions Pipeline to push the code to GCP so I can show off my awesome project!

### What has been done as of Friday 6th October 2023:

Created a simmplistic app with navbar and contact pages. Added a link to my newly created instagram page @savage.software.

Deployed this to GCP (after some troubleshooting). Realised that accessing and hosting on GCP cloud costs money.

Deployed app to github pages currently as a simple free alternative (looked briefly at firebase/firestore.)
