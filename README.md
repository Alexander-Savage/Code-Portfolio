# A place to show off!

Finally starting this project September 2023. Lets see how quickly I can link up a website (Front + Backend) to show off my skills and enthusiasm. Currently have 2 years of mostly backend experience and looking to expand my horizons.

## Some of my other backend code projects (And hopefully many more to come!):

- A.I. breast cancer predictor (small dataset, good results)
- A-Level Futher Mathematics Matrices Calculator. (As part of Computer Science A-Level NEA)
- CS50 (As a team)
- Guitar Shack (Some extreme TDD training)
